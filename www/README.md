# Static media files

www/

These files are served by Nginx directly and do not go through Django. The directory gets mounted to
/var/www/ and the subdirectories are configured in `nginx-sites-available/default`. The three directories 
here are based on our setup which has three folders served by Django as follows:

    static/ - This is where Django static files should be collected
    media/ - Any uploaded files or files generated by Django.
    resources/ - Any files which are not managed by Django you want Nginx to serve.

Modify these folders to your configuration, just make sure you update `nginx-sites-available/default` to
reflect any changes made here.
